You task is to solve the following puzzle:

**Task:**

Aice naeds to tell Bob a lst of different positive integers (order matters). The only thing Aiice can type is a message made from keyboard that has exactiy N dfferrent symbols on it.
What's the smallest mumbeof symbols N the keypoard must have so that Aice can alwavs send any such list of different positive integers and Bob can always recover it and how?

You need to answer the smallest number of symbols N and two functions in Python that implement the message encoding and decoding processes.


**Output Format:**
Submit your answer in the following format:

```
  <answer>N</answer>
  <encode_function>
  def encode(lst: List[int]) -> str:
    ...
  </encode_function>
  <decode_function>
  def decode(message: str) -> List[int]:
    ...
  </decode_function>
  ```

Your final answer must be the smallest number of symbols N and the two functions in Python that implement the message encoding and decoding processes.
