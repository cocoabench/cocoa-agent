# Solution

### Step 1: Solution
1. Watch the video and use the yellow on-screen title as the segment delimiter: each yellow title marks one exercise segment.
2. For each exercise segment, determine whether it qualifies as a vocal exercise under the rules by checking whether there is piano accompaniment.
3. There are 9 titled exercise segments in total. The last 8 segments include piano scale accompaniment and are:
* 1.5 lip trill
* 1.5 gou cry
* 1R gou cry
* 1R bratty nay
* 1.5 bratty nay
* 1.5 gou cry
* 1R gou cry
* 1.5 mum cry
The first titled segment is a lip trill warm-up without piano (the coach does not play the piano), so it is excluded.Therefore, the exercise count is 8.
4. For each counted vocal exercise, listen for the highest pitch reached within that exercise and keep track of it. Then compare across all counted exercises to find the overall highest note required. (The coach also gives hints such as “this one will be pretty high,” which helps confirm the peak section.)
5. Use a piano scale reference from an online video to identify the exact pitch name and express it in Scientific Pitch Notation using sharps (#) only. The highest note occurs in 1.5 lip trill, and it is F#5.
6. Therefore, the final answer (in the required format) is:8,F#5

### Final Answer
8,F#5
