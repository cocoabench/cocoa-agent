**Task:**

You are given a video that contains vocal practice segments accompanied by piano playing. Please answer the following questions based only on the content of the video:
1. Exercise Count: How many distinct vocal exercises are included in the video? A vocal exercise is defined as a continuous practice segment in which the vocal coach plays the piano. Any practice not following a piano should not be counted. If the same vocal exercise content appears multiple times in the video but in non-consecutive segments, each occurrence should be counted as a separate exercise.
2. Highest Note Reached: Assuming someone completes all vocal exercises in this video without stopping or giving up, what is the highest musical note this person is required to reach in the video? Please report the note using Scientific Pitch Notation, and if the note needs to be written in sharp or flat, use sharp (#) (do not use flat such as ♭ or b).
    
**Output Format:**

Submit your answer in the following format:

```
<answer><exercise_count>,<highest_note_in_scientific_pitch_notation_with_sharps></answer>
```
