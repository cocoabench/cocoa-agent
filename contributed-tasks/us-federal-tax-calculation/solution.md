## Key Reasoning

1. **Total Income:** $95,000 + $72,000 + $2,800 + $5,200 = $175,000

2. **Above-the-line deductions:**
   - Traditional IRA: $6,500
   - Student Loan Interest: Partially deductible (phase-out applies for MAGI > $155,000)

3. **Itemized vs Standard Deduction:**
   - Itemized: $18,000 (mortgage) + $8,500 (property tax) + $6,000 (charity) = $32,500
   - Standard (MFJ 2024): $29,200
   - **Use itemized deductions** since $32,500 > $29,200

4. **Investment Income Taxation:**
   - Qualified dividends and long-term capital gains taxed at preferential rates (0%/15%/20%)

## Final Answer

The Federal income tax (Regular Taxes) is **$19,693**.
