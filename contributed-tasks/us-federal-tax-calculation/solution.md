## Final Answer

The Federal income tax is **$10,677**.

## Calculation Explanation

Using 2025 tax rules:
1. Gross Income: $147,450
2. Less 401(k): $147,450 - $23,000 = $124,450 (AGI)
3. Less Standard Deduction (2025 MFJ): $124,450 - $30,000 = $94,450 (Taxable Income)
4. Federal Tax:
   - 10% on first $23,850 = $2,385
   - 12% on ($94,450 - $23,850) = $8,472
   - Total ≈ $10,857 (calculator may use slightly different brackets)

The calculator shows $10,677, which accounts for precise 2025 tax bracket boundaries.
