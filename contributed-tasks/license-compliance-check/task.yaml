  Analyze the license compliance of npm package **@angular/cli@17.0.0**.

  The Angular CLI is licensed under MIT. You need to verify that all its dependencies have compatible licenses.

  **Tasks:**

  1. Install @angular/cli@17.0.0 and analyze its complete dependency tree.
  2. Identify all unique packages and their licenses.
  3. Research any unfamiliar licenses to understand their terms.
  4. Determine license compatibility.

  **Answer the following questions:**

  1. How many unique packages are in the dependency tree (including the root package)?
  2. How many different license types are used across all packages?
  3. List all packages that use the "BlueOak-1.0.0" license (package names only, without version numbers).
  4. Which package uses the "CC-BY-3.0" license? (package name only, without version number)
  5. Is "BlueOak-1.0.0" a permissive or copyleft license? You may need to search online to find out.
  6. Are all dependencies compatible with the MIT license? (Answer: "yes" or "no")
  7. Which license in this dependency tree requires attribution when redistributing?

  **Output Format:**

  Submit your answer in the following JSON format:

  ```
  <answer>
  {
    "total_packages": 230,
    "license_types_count": 10,
    "blueoak_packages": ["package1", "package2", "package3"],
    "cc_by_package": "package-name",
    "blueoak_type": "permissive",
    "mit_compatible": "yes",
    "attribution_license": "CC-BY-3.0"
  }
  </answer>
  ```

  **Notes:**
  - Use tools like `npm ls`, `npx license-checker`, or similar to analyze dependencies.
  - For unfamiliar licenses, search online to understand their terms and compatibility.
  - Package names should not include version numbers (e.g., use "lodash" not "lodash@4.17.21").
